This would be a simple first approach that covers all the things that we need to have in the project to opt for the max grade

User(id_p, name, surname1, surname2, email)

Business(id_p, CIF, type, address, latitude, schedule, longitude, ratings, capacity)

Restaurant(business_id*{related to business UC|DC}, capability, type)

Hairdressers(business_id*{related to business UC|DC}, nbarbers)

User_favourites(id_p, business_id*{related to business}, user_id*{related to user})

Reservations(b_id, u_id, time, duration)

 - Define .java files for each of the relations
 - Define that when new business is inserted it must be inserted correctly.
 - Add a button in user view to add a business to favourites, must be done correctly following the schema.
